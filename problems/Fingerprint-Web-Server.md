# Fingerprint Web Server 

Well, I put it here just because it is a big task in web app security, in fact, there have been various somewhat successful solutions. 

I came across this problem from a homework on computer network, but TA did not talk about the answer in detail. At that time, I did not know how to use a proper keyword to describe the problem and did not get a good answer, but lately I came across it again while browsing zhihu(a web social app), a hacker I was following answered the question and I know it should be described as ```web server fingerprint```.

other answers below also helped a lot. Not going to talk a lot about the problem here, for I have not dived deep into and may not give something valuable here, but links in the REF are really worth reading, especially the first one, it talked a lot in details. There are also many challenging problems related, like detect specific web apps running on the server. 

Recorede the problem here for it is really fascinating!
