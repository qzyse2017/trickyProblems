# Tricky Problem

Collecting some tricky problems I encountered with. As the title may indicate, they can be rather tough, I have not thinked of some good enough solutions for these problems.

If you have something want to share with me, go to [issue area](https://github.com/qzyse2017/trickProblems/issues/new) and we can discuss here, pull requests will also be welcome a lot!
